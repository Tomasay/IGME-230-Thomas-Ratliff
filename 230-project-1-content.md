# Upstate Skate

## High Concept
While skateboarding and doing tricks through upstate New York, the player must avoid hitting obstacles and wiping out

## Genre
Endless Runner / Survival

## Platform
Primarily desktop, but hopefully mobile friendly as well

## Story
The player is just having fun and trying to do as many tricks as possible

## Esthetics
Graphics style - Simple cartoonish style
Sound - Simple sound effect for when the player avoids or hits an obstacle, maybe with some calm background music

## Gameplay
Mechanics - The player must jump to do tricks over each obstacle, or duck to avoid them. The game will become increasingly faster over time
Controls - Player will hit the up button to jump and down button to duck, swipe up and down on mobile
Teaching the game - When the game starts, a message will pop up on screen briefly explaining the controls

## Inspiration
I'm aiming for a simple art style and game mechanic similar to Google's dino run game
